Easy but powerful\r\nconfiguration via properties file and some additional helpful logging methods.\r\nEasy analogue of popular log4j library.\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nIf you want to use Android Logger in your Android application you need to do\r\njust the following simple steps:\r\n\r\n1. Add Android Logger as a library.\r\n\r\n2. You need to configure Android Logger\r\n\r\nPlace the following android-logger.properties file to your source directory:\r\n\r\n    # Android Logger configuration example\r\n    \r\n    # By default logger will print only ERROR (and higher) messages\r\n    # with \"MyApplication\" tag\r\n    root=ERROR:MyApplication\r\n    \r\n    # DEBUG (and higher) messages from classes of com.example.database\r\n    # will be logged with \"MyApplication-Database\" tag\r\n    logger.com.example.database=DEBUG:MyApplication-Database\r\n    \r\n    # All messages from classes of com.example.ui will be logged with\r\n    # \"MyApplication-UI\" tag\r\n    logger.com.example.ui=MyApplication-UI\r\n\r\nThe configuration manages which log tag will be used to print messages and\r\nwhich logging level filter will be applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n    logger.<package/classname>=<level>:<tag>\r\n    # or\r\n    logger.<package/classname>=<tag>\r\n\r\nThe rest of messages will be managed by root logger:\r\n\r\n    root=<level>:<tag>\r\n    # or\r\n    root=<tag>\r\n\r\nYou can use VERBOSE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, ASSERT as level in\r\nconfiguration files.\r\n\r\n3. You need to get logger instance to print messages\r\n\r\nYou can use LoggerManager to get a logger instance to print messages.\r\n\r\n    package com.example.ui;\r\n\r\n    import com.noveogroup.android.log.Logger;\r\n    import com.noveogroup.android.log.LoggerManager;\r\n\r\n    public class MainActivity extends Activity {\r\n\r\n      // get a logger instance by name\r\n      private static final Logger logger = LoggerManager.getLogger(\"com.example.ui.MyActivity\");\r\n      // get a logger instance by class\r\n      private static final Logger logger = LoggerManager.getLogger(MainActivity.class);\r\n      // just to use current class\r\n      private static final Logger logger = LoggerManager.getLogger();\r\n\r\n      private void foo(int value) {\r\n        logger.i(\"entered MainActivity::foo value=%d\", value);\r\n        \r\n        try {\r\n          // some code\r\n        } catch(IOException e) {\r\n          logger.e(\"I/O error occurred\", e);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSLF4J compatibility\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nAndroid Logger is SLF4J compatible. For example, you can write such code in\r\nyour library:\r\n\r\n    import org.slf4j.Logger;\r\n    import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;\r\n\r\n    public class Bar {\r\n\r\n      private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Bar.class);\r\n\r\n      public void foo(int value) {\r\n        logger.info(\"entered Bar::foo value={}\", value);\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n          // some code\r\n        } catch(IOException e) {\r\n          logger.error(\"I/O error occurred\", e);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSuppose you compiled your library as JAR-file and publish it. After that anyone\r\nwho uses your JAR library will be able to add any SLF4J implementation to\r\nchange the way how the library logs messages.\r\nThe most powerful implementation of SLF4J is [LOGBack](http://logback.qos.ch/)\r\navailable for Android. Unfortunately, it has about 1 Mb size and it may be\r\ncritical for some Android applications.\r\nAndroid Logger is SLF4J compatible too. So you can just add its JAR as\r\na library to get all your log messages in Android LogCat.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n============\r\n\r\n1. ...\r\n\r\nDeveloped By\r\n============\r\n\r\n* [Noveo Group][1]\r\n* Pavel Stepanov - <pstepanov@noveogroup.com>\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\n    Copyright (c) 2013 Noveo Group\r\n\r\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\n    of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\n    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\n    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\n    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\n    all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n    Except as contained in this notice, the name(s) of the above copyright holders\r\n    shall not be used in advertising or otherwise to promote the sale, use or\r\n    other dealings in this Software without prior written authorization.\r\n\r\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\n    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
